<p>Write a program to ask yourself, using prompt, what the value of 2 + 2 is. If the answer is "4", use alert to say something praising. If it is "3" or "5", say "Almost!". In other cases, say something mean.</p>

<p>Add a while and optionally a break to your solution for the previous exercise, so that it keeps repeating the question until a correct answer is given.</p>

<p>Note that while (true) ... can be used to create a loop that does not end on its own account. This is a bit silly, you ask the program to loop as long as true is true, but it is a useful trick.</p>

<p>Cleaner solution:</p>
<pre>
var value = null;
while (value != "4") {
  value = prompt("You! What is the value of 2 + 2?", "");
  if (value == "4")
    alert("You must be a genius or something.");
  else if (value == "3" || value == "5")
    alert("Almost!");
  else
    alert("You're an embarrassment.");
}</pre>

<script>

var sumValue;

while (true) {
  var sumValue = prompt("What is 2+2?", "");
  if (sumValue == "4") {
    alert("You got it right!");
    break;
  }
  else if (sumValue == "3" || sumValue == "5") {
    alert("You are close...");
  }  
  else {
    alert("YOU'RE SO WRONG!");
  }
}

</script>
