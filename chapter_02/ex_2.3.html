<p>With some slight modifications, the solution to the previous exercise can be made to draw a triangle. And when I say 'draw a triangle' I mean 'print out some text that almost looks like a triangle when you squint'.</p>

<p>Print out ten lines. On the first line there is one '#' character. On the second there are two. And so on.</p>

<p>How does one get a string with X '#' characters in it? One way is to build it every time it is needed with an 'inner loop' â€• a loop inside a loop. A simpler way is to reuse the string that the previous iteration of the loop used, and add one character to it.</p>

<script>
  var totalValue = 1, count = 0, hashtags = '';
  while (count < 10) {
    hashtags += '#';
    console.log(hashtags);
    count += 1;
    totalValue = totalValue * 2;
  }
</script>
