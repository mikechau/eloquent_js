<p>Write a function called absolute, which returns the absolute value of the number it is given as its argument. The absolute value of a negative number is the positive version of that same number, and the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is that number itself.</p>

<script>
  function absolute(number) {
    return Math.abs(number);
  }

  console.log(absolute(-144));
</script>
