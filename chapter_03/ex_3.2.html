<p>Write a function greaterThan, which takes one argument, a number, and returns a function that represents a test. When this returned function is called with a single number as argument, it returns a boolean: true if the given number is greater than the number that was used to create the test function, and false otherwise.</p>

<script>
  function greaterThan(number) {
    return function (test) {
      console.log("test: " + test);
      console.log("number: " + number);
      return test > number;
    };
  }

  var greaterThanTen = greaterThan(10);
  console.log(greaterThanTen(9));
</script>
