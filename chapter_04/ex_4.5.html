<p>Can you write a function catNames that takes a paragraph as an argument and returns an array of names?

Strings have an indexOf method that can be used to find the (first) position of a character or sub-string within that string. Also, when slice is given only one argument, it will return the part of the string from the given position all the way to the end.

It can be helpful to use the console to 'explore' functions. For example, type "foo: bar".indexOf(":") and see what you get.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">

/* show(catNames("born 20/09/2004 (mother Yellow Bess): " +
              "Doctor Hobbles the 2nd, Noog")); */

function catNames(paragraph) {
  var colon = paragraph.indexOf(":");
  return paragraph.slice(colon + 2).split(", ");
}

var para = catNames("born 20/09/2004 (mother Yellow Bess): " + "Doctor Hobbles the 2nd, Noog");

console.log(para);
